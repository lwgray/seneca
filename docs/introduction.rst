Introduction
============

What is Seneca?
---------------

Seneca is an open-source conversation visualization platform designed specifically
for Marcus AI systems. It provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and visualization
of agent conversations, enabling developers and operators to:

* Monitor agent communications in real-time
* Analyze conversation patterns and trends
* Track task progress and dependencies
* Identify bottlenecks and performance issues
* Gain insights into system behavior

Why Seneca?
-----------

Marcus AI systems involve complex interactions between multiple agents, task
managers, and external services. Understanding these interactions is crucial for:

**Development**
  Debug agent behavior, test new features, and understand system flow

**Operations**
  Monitor system health, identify issues early, and ensure smooth operation

**Optimization**
  Find bottlenecks, improve task allocation, and enhance overall performance

**Compliance**
  Audit agent decisions, track task completion, and maintain records

Key Concepts
------------

Conversations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Marcus, a conversation represents any communication between system components:

* **Worker to PM** - Agents reporting progress or requesting tasks
* **PM to Worker** - Task assignments and instructions
* **Blockers** - Reports of issues preventing progress
* **Decisions** - PM decisions about task allocation

Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seneca transforms raw conversation logs into:

* **Timeline Views** - See conversations chronologically
* **Graph Visualizations** - Understand agent relationships
* **Statistical Charts** - Analyze patterns and trends
* **Real-time Dashboards** - Monitor live system activity

Analysis
~~~~~~~~

Built-in analysis capabilities include:

* **Statistical Analysis** - Counts, averages, distributions
* **Temporal Analysis** - Time-based patterns and trends
* **Behavioral Analysis** - Agent activity patterns
* **Performance Metrics** - System efficiency indicators

Architecture Philosophy
-----------------------

Seneca follows these design principles:

**Simplicity**
  Easy to install, configure, and use

**Performance**
  Minimal overhead, efficient log processing

**Extensibility**
  Plugin architecture for custom analyzers

**Privacy**
  All data stays local, no external dependencies

**Open Source**
  MIT licensed, community-driven development
